Hi Eric,

it's me again. Hope everything is ok with you.

I started working with python and because python 2.5 comes with ctypes
included I started to wrap some XPA functionality. In the web I only
found PyXPA 0.2 which is very alpha. And with ctypes, we don't need any
c-code linked in, python package is enough.

Although I have wrapped only the functionality I need for now, I think
it is already usable. And, of course, when you or anyone is interested
in it, I can easily add more functionality.

There is no installation needed. Just adjust the path to your libxpa.so
in XPAClient.py and XPAServer.py and optionally adjust NXPA in
XCPAClient.py.

Then you can start stest and run test_XPAC.py or run test_XPAS.py and
issue some xpainfo/get/set commands.



Regards,
Bernhard
